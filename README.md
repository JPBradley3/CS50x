This is a repository for Harvard's CS50x course projects.

These are my solutions to the problem sets and they can be run locally. Some may contain web applications and need more than the terminal input of "python app_name.py" to run.

In this case to run a Python web application locally, navigate to your project directory in the terminal, then execute the command python app.py (where "app.py" is the name of your Python file containing the web application logic), which will start a local server; you can then access your application in a web browser by going to http://localhost:5000 (or the specified port number in your code).
